# video-action-similarity
This system is used to measure the similarity between pairs of videos using a BoW methodology.
The videos were taken from the ASLAN video set.
The file "train.cpp" trains the system by reading videos, extracting their descriptors and storing them as a dictionary.
"test.cpp" is used for testing the similarity of a pair of video.
